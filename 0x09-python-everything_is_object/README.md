# Python Everything is Object

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will gain a deep understanding of various Python concepts without the need for external assistance. These include:

### General
1. **Why Python Programming is Awesome**
2. **Object Basics**
    - What is an object
    - Difference between a class and an object or instance
    - Difference between immutable and mutable objects
    - What is a reference
    - What is an assignment
    - What is an alias
3. **Variable Comparison**
    - How to determine if two variables are identical
    - How to determine if two variables point to the same object
    - Displaying variable identifiers (memory addresses in the CPython implementation)
4. **Mutable and Immutable Concepts**
    - Understanding mutability and immutability
    - Built-in mutable types
    - Built-in immutable types
5. **Function Argument Passing**
    - How Python passes variables to functions

## Requirements
- **Python Scripts:** Use vi, vim, or emacs as editors.
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- **File Endings:** All script files should end with a newline character.
- **Shebang Line:** The first line of all script files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README File:** A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- **Code Style:** Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable.
- **File Length:** File length will be tested using `wc`.
