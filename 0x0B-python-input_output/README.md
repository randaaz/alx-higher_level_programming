# Project Title: 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Overview

This project covers various aspects of Python input/output operations. It includes tasks related to reading and writing files, working with JSON, and implementing serialization and deserialization.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Open and manipulate files in Python
- Understand the basics of file input/output
- Work with JSON data format
- Implement serialization and deserialization
- Develop a basic understanding of Python's `with` statement

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

1. **0-read_file.py**: Reads and prints the content of a text file.
2. **1-write_file.py**: Writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.
3. **2-append_write.py**: Appends a string to the end of a text file and returns the number of characters added.
4. **3-to_json_string.py**: Converts an object (string) to its JSON representation.
5. **4-from_json_string.py**: Converts a JSON string to a Python object.
6. **5-save_to_json_file.py**: Writes an object to a text file using a JSON representation.
7. **6-load_from_json_file.py**: Creates an object from a JSON file.
8. **7-add_item.py**: Adds arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file.
9. **8-class_to_json.py**: Returns the dictionary description of an object for JSON serialization.
10. **9-student.py**: Defines a `Student` class with public instance attributes and a `to_json` method.
11. **10-student.py**: Extends the `Student` class to include a filtering mechanism in the `to_json` method.
12. **11-student.py**: Adds a `reload_from_json` method to the `Student` class for attribute replacement.
13. **12-pascal_triangle.py**: Generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## How to Use

Each Python script can be executed individually. For example:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
