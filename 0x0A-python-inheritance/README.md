# Project Title: Python Inheritance

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

### General
1. Explain why Python programming is awesome.
2. Define and understand the concepts of superclass, base class, or parent class.
3. Understand the concept of a subclass.
4. List all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
5. Determine when an instance can have new attributes.
6. Inherit a class from another.
7. Define a class with multiple base classes.
8. Identify the default class every class inherits from.
9. Override a method or attribute inherited from the base class.
10. Identify attributes or methods available by inheritance to subclasses.
11. Explain the purpose of inheritance.
12. Use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions.

## Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are expected to come up with solutions for the tasks to meet the learning objectives.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
- Do not publish any content from this project.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for code style checking.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases
- All your test files should end with a new line.
- All your test files should be inside a folder named `tests`.
- All your test files should be text files with the extension `.txt`.
- All your tests should be executed by using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- All your modules, classes, and functions should have documentation.

### Documentation
- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments.
- Provide meaningful documentation for modules, classes, and functions.
