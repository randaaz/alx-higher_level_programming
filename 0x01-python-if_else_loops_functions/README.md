# Project Title: 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description
This project focuses on Python programming, covering topics such as if/else statements, loops, functions, and more. It consists of several tasks to test your understanding and implementation of these concepts.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the importance of Python programming.
- Work with if/else statements and loops.
- Use functions effectively.
- Handle various Python programming concepts and features.

## Requirements
- Python scripts should be created using Python 3.8.5.
- All Python files should end with a newline.
- The first line of Python files should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory and should be included in the root directory.
- Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) to maintain code style.
- All Python files must be executable.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Positive or Negative
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable 'number' and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Task 1: The Last Digit
This program assigns a random signed number to the variable 'number' and prints the last digit of the number, along with some conditions.
