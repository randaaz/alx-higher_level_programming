## Project Description

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and tasks designed to introduce you to the world of Python programming. Whether you're new to Python or looking to sharpen your skills, these tasks will help you get started and understand some essential Python concepts.

## Concepts

For this project, you're expected to explore the following Python concept:

- Python programming

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, you can refer to the following resources:

- [The Python tutorial (only the first three chapters)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [Whetting Your Appetite](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)
- [Using the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html)
- [An Informal Introduction to Python (Read up until “3.1.2. Strings”)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)
- [How To Use String Formatters in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)
- [Learn to Program](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://pep8.org/)
- [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Identify who created Python and where the name 'Python' comes from.
- Describe the Zen of Python.
- Use the Python interpreter.
- Print text and variables using the `print` function.
- Work with strings, indexing, and slicing in Python.
- Follow the official Python coding style using PEP8 and check your code with pycodestyle.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository is mandatory.
- Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Shell Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- All your files must be executable.

### C Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- Your code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `lists.h`.
- Don't forget to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.

## Tasks

Here's a brief overview of the tasks in this project. Each task can be found in its respective directory:

1. Run Python file
2. Run inline
3. Hello, print
4. Print integer
5. Print float
6. Print string
7. Play with strings
8. Copy - Cut - Paste
9. Create a new sentence
10. Linked list cycle
11. 11. 3 advanced tasks

## Technical Interview Preparation

For technical interview preparation, you are tasked with writing a C function that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle. The implementation details can be found in the task directory.

## Author's Disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world!

The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher-level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.

Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.

Enjoy!
