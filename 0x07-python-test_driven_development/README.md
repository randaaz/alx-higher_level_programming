# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Introduction
This project focuses on Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. The goal is to write functions and corresponding test cases using the `unittest` module. The project aims to reinforce understanding of Python programming concepts, documentation, and the importance of writing tests before implementing code.

## Project Details

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an interactive test is
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- Basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- All test files should end with a new line.
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`.
- All test files should have the extension `.txt`.
- Tests should be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- A documentation is not a simple word; itâ€™s a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length will be verified).
- Working together on test cases is encouraged to cover all possible cases.
